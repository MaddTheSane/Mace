Please read the README and MODIFY files before compiling Mace.

This file contains information on getting Mace to compile on several
platforms.

-Linux x86-
This is the primary development platform for Mace. The source code will
compile on RedHat 5.2 and most other Linux and Unix variants using the
included Makefiles.

-Windows x86-
The source code will compile with Symantec C++ 7.5 for Win32 as a Windows 95
console application. It should also work with minimal or no porting on other
Win32 compilers.

-Alpha (and other 64-bit machines)-
By default, the type U32 is defined as an unsigned long. On 64-bit machines
a long is 64-bits, not 32. However, an int is 32-bits. You must edit
"Globals.h" and replace the "long" in the U32 and S32 typedefs with "int". I
believe that Alpha's are big endian machines so you should also review the
section "Big Endian Machines". There may also be additional problems with
Mace on 64-bit machines.

-Big Endian Machines-
Most non-x86 machines are big endian machines. Mace has problems with big
endian machines. Please post any questions or solutions that you find to
the Mace Forum. The Forum is available by e-mail and on the Mace Web Site
