The Mace Project
http://www.macehq.cx/
=====================

Introduction
------------

Mace is a Macintosh compatibility layer which will run Macintosh
applications as though they were designed to run on the system that Mace
is running on. See the Mace web site for a more complete description of Mace
and it's project goals. This is a development release intended for developers
who wish to add to the project and help get Mace running it's first Macintosh
application. See the file "TODO" for a list of the high priority things to do.

The 68000 CPU core is from the public domain "68000 Assembler/Simulator
Version 1.0", written by the North Carolina State University's
Electrical and Computer Engineering department. It has been heavily
modified for use in Mace. I suspect that there are more than a few bugs
lurking in it.

Notes
-----
Once compiled, you can start Mace by typing  ./Mace <filename>
Where <filename> is the file name of the Apple Double resource fork of the
application which you want Mace to run. Both ARDI's Executor and HFS volumes
mounted using the newer Linux kernels use a % character at the beginning of
the file name to indicate the Apple Double resource fork. Files that do not
have this character are the data forks. Apple Double data forks are simply
raw data forks, but Apple Double resource forks are NOT raw resource forks.
Mace will NOT work with raw resource forks at this time.

We are emulating the A-Line (AKA Line A) traps for the MacOS and the
Toolbox (the ROM). The trap dispatcher is in Toolbox.c. Read the legal
information (at the end of this file) and the file "MODIFY" before you
modify Mace in any way.

See the file "Compiling.txt" for information on how to get Mace to compile
on various platforms.
