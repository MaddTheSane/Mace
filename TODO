To Do List
============

-Get a good LGPL compatible 680x0 CPU core that isn't full of bugs! UAE???

-Figure out: should GetResource return a value in A0 or in the stack???
-Fix: GetNamedResource
-Fix: Return values in Toolbox emulation

-Fix: LoadSeg
  keep track of which code segments are already loaded, and their
  locations. Maybe just have our Resource Manager keep track of
  loaded resources...

-Implement: Master Pointers!!! In Resources and Memory!

-Implement: Support for Mac Binary files
